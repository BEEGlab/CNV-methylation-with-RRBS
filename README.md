# CNV-methylation-with-RRBS

## Description


This project aimed to assess DNA methylation of copy number variations (CNVs) in threespine sticklebacks using RRBS. It investigated the role of DNA methylation in the evolution and adaptive divergence of duplicated genes in threespine sticklebacks across salinity gradients. Despite the potential benefits of gene duplication for adaptation, dosage imbalance can destabilize cells. Our findings suggest that while DNA methylation is linked to young duplicate genes, it does not strongly interact with copy number variations (CNVs), challenging the hypothesis that methylation significantly contributes to dosage regulation following duplication.

This Git includes R scripts for analyzing genetic data, aiming to understand methylation patterns across CNVs.

The scripts published here have been used in the manuscript **"Epigenetic diversity of genes with copy number variations among natural populations of the three-spined stickleback"** by Frédéric J. J. Chain, Britta S. Meyer, Melanie J. Heckwolf, Sören Franzenburg, Christophe Eizaguirre and Thorsten B.H. Reusch. We will add the DOI/link as soon as the publication is fully accepted.
